// similar to "flex countdown".. Given 4 parameters (param1, param2, param3, param4) you can name it however you like.
// print the multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3.
// One exception: if a multiple is equal to param4, then skip (don't print) that one.
// do this using a WHILE loop.
// for example.. Given (3, 5, 17, 9), print 6, 12, 15 (which are all multiples of 3 between 5 and 17, except for 9).
